# Managed & External Users

## 管理対象ユーザー

Managed Users are accounts in a Box enterprise that Admins and Co-Admins can directly edit, delete, enforce security settings, and run reports against through the Admin Console. These users consume a standard Box license and often, but not always, share the same email domain.

<Message>

# 管理者ユーザーとしてログイン

Some applications need permissions that only Admins have in order to properly operate and therefore require an Admin to log in.

An example of this would be a security application that monitors enterprise events and takes action on suspicious events. The events endpoint can only be used by Admins or a Co-Admin with permission to access reporting.

</Message>

### 制限

* Server to Server applications must have "App + Enterprise" application access configured in the [Developer Console][dc] to access Managed User's content. 

* Server to Server application cannot act on behalf of a Managed Users when unless the application is configured to "Perform Actions as Users" or "Generate User Access Tokens".

## 外部ユーザー

An externally managed user, or External User, is a Managed User that belongs to a different enterprise. An external user is often encountered with collaborations. External users are often encountered when they are collaborated in on content owned by a user of the application's enterprise, or when they authorize an OAuth 2.0 application. These users still have their own Box accounts, but cannot be managed via the Admin Console.

### 制限

* Because External Users do not belong to the application's enterprise, they will not return when retrieving a list of all users for an enterprise.
* Applications cannot create, edit, or otherwise manage External Users.
